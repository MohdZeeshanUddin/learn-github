# Attention to details

## What

Can you spot the 5 differences between the two images below?

> Hint: Differences can be subtle and not always where you think they may be!

## Why

Computer Scientists and Engineers have great attention to detail. If they didnâ€™t, complex systems like airplanes, cars, and computers would not work!

Spotting differences/bugs helps programmers write better programs and solve problems. The smallest differences may result in major effects so checking for errors/bugs is essential.
