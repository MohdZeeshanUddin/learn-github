Answers are as follows:

- The first light House Contains the value **36** becouse the series contains the difference of 5.
<br>
- The Second Light House contains the value **28** becouse the series is like
<br> 
0, 0+1 = 1, 1+2 = 3, 3+3 = 6, 6+4 = 10, 10+5 = 15, 15+6 = 21, 21+7 = 28
<br>
- The Third light House Contains the value of **64** becouse the series is square root of Numbers.
<br>
- The last light house contians the value of **21** becouse it is fibonachi series in which every new number N is equal to **N = N + N-1**.
